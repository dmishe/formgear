At this moment only \r\nMongoDB is allowed. \r\n\r\nImagine what happends when you plan to create new site (for yourself or \r\nclient). You doing several steps and one important is make row draft of what\r\ncontent you will publish and retation between different types of content. \r\nUsually it implies you bootstrap your framework, step over several stages of\r\ncreating scaffold and only then write models code. In the worst case you write \r\nSQL. \r\n\r\nBut we are living in 21 century, have decoded DNA, pushing frontier into \r\nspace, diging into core of the atoms and listening dubstep! Why we must to \r\nwrite all that crap? Why computers cann't just do all this stuff?\r\n\r\nSo that is why we invent ``formgear``. Because we want computers to do that they\r\nsupposed to do. \r\n\r\n`formgear` is only part of this effort, but here is already some results. So,\r\nexample how to make simple model. We use `YAML` because it is very human \r\nreadeable. Minimal file::\r\n\r\n    # user.yaml\r\n    title: User\r\n    description: >\r\n      This is user model. \r\n\r\n    fields:\r\n      - name: name\r\n      - name: email\r\n      - name: site\r\n      - name: about\r\n\r\nThis file is enough to use it as model in your python code::\r\n\r\n    # models.py\r\n    from formgear.models import Model\r\n    class User(Model):\r\n        __yaml__ = 'user.yaml'\r\n\r\n``formgear`` is only a library for bigger framework, if you deside to use whole \r\nstack then you will get site with admin section including list, edit, add, \r\nsearch, delete sections for each models.\r\n\r\nMore\r\n======\r\n\r\nLinks:\r\n\r\n* ``formgear`` page on PyPI: `http://pypi.python.org/pypi/formgear/ \r\n  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/formgear//>`_\r\n* Github page: `https://github.com/xen/formgear \r\n  <https://github.com/xen/formgear>`_\r\n\r\nMore documentation is approaching.\r\n\r\n","google":""}
